/* A county collects property taxes on the value of property, which is 60 percent of the property's value. 
If an acre of land is valued at $10,000 its assessment value is $6000. The property tax is then 75 cents for each $100 of the assessment value. 
The tax for the acre is assessed at $6000 will be $45.
Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax. */
